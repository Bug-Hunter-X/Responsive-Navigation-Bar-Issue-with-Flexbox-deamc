The issue stems from the lack of specifying `flex-basis` property in the `.nav-item` class.  Adding `flex-basis: 0` will ensure that the items' flex-grow property works correctly and items will distribute evenly.  Additionally, setting `width: auto` can sometimes help avoid unexpected behavior.

Here's the corrected CSS:

```css
.nav {
  display: flex;
}
.nav-item {
  flex: 1;
  flex-basis: 0;
  width: auto;
}
```
This revised CSS ensures that each navigation item takes up an equal proportion of the available space, fixing the vertical stacking issue.
